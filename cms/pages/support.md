### HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?

Salon 21: Petite Piano Concerts is a 501(3)(c) non-profit organization. We believe that classical music is for everyone, therefore all concerts are free of charge with a $15 suggested donation. Become more involved with Salon 21: Petite Piano Concerts by making your charitable contribution today. Help us continue presenting up-close and personal piano concerts!
