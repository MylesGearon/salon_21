### Our Mission

We believe that classical music is for everyone. Our mission is to break down the barriers between performer and audience, foster meaningful conversation, and facilitate learning for a new classical music audience while providing an outlet for the young professional pianist to perform. All concerts are free of charge with a $15 suggested donation.



Salon 21: Petite Piano Concerts is a non-profit charitable corporation.
