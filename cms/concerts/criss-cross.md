  *Criss-Cross* is a multi-genre collaboration that mixes the structure of
  classical music with the beats of hip-hop and free improvisation. NYC-based
  pianist Mikael Darmanie joins forces with local beatmaker Alex Stallings, aka
  “Stallitix,” Executive Director of Thrive presented by Elementz, to create an
  inspired dialogue between rhythm and music.
