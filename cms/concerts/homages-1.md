  Salon 21 opens the sixth season with an ode to the creative muses. Homages is
  an exploration of artistic inspiration. What were the forces that made such
  composers truly great? For J.S. Bach, this was his older brothers who taught
  him music, and for whom the Capriccio on the Departure of a Beloved Brother
  was written. Clara Schumann’s Sonata in G minor was dedicated to her beloved
  husband, Robert. Beethoven’s penultimate and powerful Sonata in A-flat Major,
  op. 110 offers a musical memoir of his life bringing forth a tale of despair
  and triumph. 




  Artistic influences continue to present themselves in the 20th century with
  Olivier Messiaen’s Preludes in imitation of his idol Claude Debussy, and
  later, Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu’s Rain Tree Sketch II, memorializing
  Messiaen. The genesis and continuation of reverence is a beautiful tradition
  that will live on forever.
