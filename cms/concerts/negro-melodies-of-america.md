  Salon 21 is honored to host pianist Dr. Leah Claiborne as we celebrate Black
  History Month. Negro Melodies of America is a performance that highlights
  piano works by Black composers who have used arrangements of Negro Melodies,
  or “Spirituals,” in their compositions. Spirituals combine the influences of
  West African rhythms and melodies with the influences of European Christian
  Hymns to portray the hardships African slaves endured in America. This genre
  opens a door to a time capsule during a dark period in American history. These
  melodies speak to the soul of humanity and as its name suggests, is arguably
  some of the most spiritually powerful music that ever emerged from this
  country. Dr. Claiborne will be performing selections from Samuel Coleridge
  Taylor’s 24 Negro Melodies as well as other Black American composers who have
  arranged Spirituals for solo piano.
