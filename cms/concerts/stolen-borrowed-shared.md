programNotes: >-
  Stolen, Borrowed, Shared features transcriptions for flute and piano that were
  originally written for other ensemble formations. Because the flute has a
  unique timbre and technical flexibility, flutists can easily borrow music (or
  steal, depending on the point of view) from existing pieces originally written
  for other virtuosic treble instruments, such as violin and voice. Flutist
  Annie Darlin Gordon and pianist Jill Jantzen will explore this concept of
  "shared music" with bold repertoire including Cesar Franck's Sonata for Violin
  and Piano and Schubert’s vocal piece Introduction and Variations on "Trockne
  Blumen.”
