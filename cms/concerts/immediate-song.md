programNotes: "*Immediate Song* is a combination concert and poetry reading
  inspired by University of Cincinnati emeritus professor Don Bogen’s latest
  book with the same title. *Immediate Song* is anchored in brief lyric poems,
  and the poet will alternate readings with musical interludes by mezzo-soprano
  Kate Tombaugh and pianist Jill Jantzen as they present settings of Bogen’s
  poetry by contemporary composers Steven Weimer and Ellen Harrison."
