programNotes: >-
  Join us for a night of music and poetry as Salon 21 closes out their sixth
  season with Immediate Song, a combination concert and poetry reading. Don
  Bogenâ€™s Immediate Song is a book of poetry that ranges from the immediacy of a
  moment to the long view of earlier civilizations. It includes street scenes,
  meditations on life in times of war, elegies, songs, and more. The poet will
  be in attendance at the beautiful Mercantile Library to read selections from
  the book, which will alternate with musical interludes by mezzo-soprano Kate
  Tombaugh and pianist Jill Jantzen as they present settings of poems from
  Immediate Song by contemporary composers Steven Weimer and Ellen Harrison.
