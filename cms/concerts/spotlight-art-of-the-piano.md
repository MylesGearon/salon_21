  We continue to celebrate Salon 21â€™s partnership with Art of the Piano, an
  internationally recognized music festival for aspiring pianists created and
  led by pianist Awadagin Pratt. Each year, an Enlight Prize is given to two
  outstanding pianists who best represent the spirit of the festival. We are
  thrilled to host one of the 2018 winners Simon Karakulidi.
