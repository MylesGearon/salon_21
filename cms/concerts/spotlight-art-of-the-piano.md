programNotes: >-
  We continue to celebrate Salon 21â€™s partnership with [Art of the
  Piano](http://artofthepiano.org/), an intimate music festival for aspiring
  pianists created and led by pianist Awadagin Pratt. Each year, an Enlight
  Prize is given to two outstanding pianists who best represent the spirit of
  the festival. We are thrilled to host 2018 Winner, Simon Karakulidi and 2019
  Winner Daria Tudor. This double feature will leave you feeling inspired and
  amazed at the music being created by these rising stars of tomorrow.
