  We continue to celebrate Salon 21â€™s partnership with [Art of the Piano](http://artofthepiano.org/), an intimate music festival for aspiring pianists created and led by pianist Awadagin Pratt. Each year, an Enlight Prize is given to two outstanding pianists who best represent the spirit of the festival. We are thrilled to host 2018 Winner, Simon Karakulidi and 2019 Winner Daria Tudor. This double feature will leave you feeling inspired and amazed at the music being created by these rising stars of tomorrow.
