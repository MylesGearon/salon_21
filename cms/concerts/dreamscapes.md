  Reality or Fantasy? Salon 21 invites audiences to experience a musical
  meditation on the nature of dreams, both abandoned and actualized with
  mezzo-soprano Lauren McAllister and pianist Stephen Variames. The program will
  feature pieces by Robert Schumann, Jake Heggie, and a premiere by Variames
  himself. Schumann’s setting of Queen Mary Stuart’s heartfelt words speaks to
  the dreams she held for her homeland, her family, and her soul. Variames
  offers an exploration of texts by Edgar Allen Poe. The night will close with
  Heggie’s Into the Fire, which offers a glimpse into the life of brilliant
  sculptor Camille Claudel and her tumultuous relationship with her lover and
  fellow sculptor, Auguste Rodin.
